Mustache.mode
=============

A [Mustache](http://mustache.github.com) syntax mode for [Coda](http://panic.com/coda)
(and possibly [SubEthaEdit](http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit)) written by
[bobthecow](http://github.com/bobthecow).



Installation
------------

Drop `Mustache.mode` into `~/Library/Application Support/Coda 2/Modes` (or `.../Coda/Modes`
if you're not using Coda 2). If that folder doesn't exist, create it.



Usage
-----

 1. Install.

 2. Open a file with a `.ms`, `.mstache`, `.mustache` or `.stache` extension in Coda or SubEthaEdit.

 3. ?

 4. Profit!



Known Issues
------------

Due to limitations of the syntax mode parser for Coda and SubEthaEdit, this doesn't respect
'Set Delimiter' tags.
